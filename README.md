# AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity Job Simulation

## Overview

This repository documents my completion of the **AIG Shields Up Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program** delivered via Forage in January 2026. The project simulates real-world security operations scenarios with a focus on **threat analysis, vulnerability management, incident response, and risk-based decision making**.

The work emphasizes **defensive cybersecurity**, prioritizing business impact, remediation strategy, and communication over technical exploitation.

---

## Program Scope

During this simulation, I worked on hands-on tasks aligned with enterprise security operations, including:

- Analysis and response to a zero-day vulnerability using public threat intelligence
- Controlled simulation of ransomware-related attack techniques
- Translation of technical findings into actionable remediation guidance
- Support of incident response decision-making under realistic constraints

---

## Key Objectives

- Assess cybersecurity threats using real advisories and incident data
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk, exposure, and business impact
- Apply Python scripting responsibly to understand attack mechanics
- Strengthen incident response and stakeholder communication skills

---

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Zero-Day Vulnerability Threat Analysis

**What was done**
- Reviewed publicly reported security incidents and CISA advisories
- Identified affected systems, potential attack vectors, and exposure scope
- Evaluated severity using risk-based criteria rather than CVSS scores alone

**How it was done**
- Correlated threat intelligence with organizational impact
- Distinguished between theoretical vulnerabilities and exploitable risk
- Proposed mitigation and remediation actions aligned with operational realities

**Outcome**
- Clear prioritization of remediation steps
- Reduced ambiguity for technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Actionable guidance suitable for SOC and security leadership consumption

---

### 2. Ransomware Response and Attack Simulation

**What was done**
- Analyzed ransomware behavior and attacker methodology
- Simulated a controlled brute-force technique using Python to understand attack feasibility

**How it was done**
- Developed a Python script in a controlled environment
- Focused on understanding encryption mechanics and response triggers
- Avoided exploit development and emphasized defensive learning

**Outcome**
- Improved understanding of ransomware kill chains
- Reinforced the importance of early detection and access control
- Strengthened incident response decision-making skills

---

### 3. Risk Communication and Incident Response Support

**What was done**
- Translated technical findings into clear remediation recommendations
- Framed security actions in terms of business risk and continuity

**How it was done**
- Simplified complex security concepts for non-technical audiences
- Prioritized clarity, impact, and execution over technical depth

**Outcome**
- Effective cross-functional communication
- Practical, decision-ready security guidance

---

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (controlled attack simulation)
- Public Threat Intelligence
- CISA Advisories
- Incident Response Frameworks
- Risk-Based Vulnerability Assessment

---

## Key Takeaways

- Security effectiveness depends on **prioritization, not volume**
- Technical skills must support **business-focused decisions**
- Clear communication is as critical as detection and response
- Defensive security requires understanding attacker behavior without replicating harm
